1. A flame war is a heated conversation between two people online. The two people that are involved in a flame war are angry so what they say would sound aggressive or offensive. If someone else reads it, they can feel the tension from the text. 

2. An emotion is what you feel under various circumstances. An emoji is an icon used to express emotions or show an object or idea. For example, if I am sad, I would use a frowny face emoji to show that I am feeling this type of emotion right now.

3. "Lossy" compression is a way to reduce the size of a file by getting rid of some data and normally it is unnoticeable. "Lossy" compression is normally used for photos, videos and audio. Sometimes "lossy" compression affects the image quality and sometimes it doesn't. 
GIF: lossless compression which has no detail loss but it's not as small as a jpg.
PNG: lossless, used mostly for web images, not for printing, allows more colors and better compression.
TIFF: lossless, uncompressed image files, contains a lot of information.
RAW: no compression, unprocessed image files from a digital camera.
