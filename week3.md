1. BBS is mostly for people that are interested in the same thing to communicate online. Aside from the ones mentioned in the book, there were professional academic BBS for people to share their ideas. Some BBS were tied to merchants and small business owners tend to find these BBS helpful since they can find answers to their problems there. 

2. The Archive Team was a group of people that tried to save the data from GeoCities and they created a number of websites for people to torrent the old websites. Torrent holds the metadata of different files so people can downkoad them.  The Archive Team downloaded 900 GB of data from GeoCities and compressed them into 625GB torrent that can be downloaded from the Pirate Bay and some other websites. This allowed interested users to browse and access the websites. 

This is an example of a website that saved the archives from GeoCities. http://www.oocities.org/#gsc.tab=0
