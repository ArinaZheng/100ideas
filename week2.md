The interet is a global network that allows all computers in the world to connect to each other. The World Wide Web is not the same as the internet. The internet is what makes the World Wide Web possible because the internet connects every computer together through a bigger network and the web is essentially an application that uses the internet to work so that people. 

Paul Otlet, a Belgian had a huge collections of documents which he called the collection of RÃ©seau and he figured out a way to categorize them by showing the relationships between the documents. And that is known as the Semantic Web. In a book that he wrote in 1935 he said "a machinery unaffected by distace ...... parts of it" (8) which is the idea of the internet. 
RAND, "a nonprofit institution that helps improve policy and decisionmaking through research and analysis" was formed after the WWII to make an artificial satellite. However, in 1957 the Soviet Union beat the US to launch the first artificial satellite into space. Because of that, Joseph Licklider, the first director of ARPA (Advaced Research Projects Agency), wanted to create an Intergalactic Computer Network. In 1958 at RAND, Paul Baran was designing a communication system that devides messages into blocks before sending them out and reassemble them before the final destination. Donald Davies, a Welsh computer scientist, came up with the idea and called it "packet switching". Later Baran and Davies decided to collaborate. Licklider and Bob Taylor who was fundinng three different projects at ARPA. With the three projects and packet switching combined, BBN Technologies connected computers at UCLA and the Standford Research Institute on 29 October 1969 and ARPANET was created. Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf later invented Internet Protocol to solve the problem that the networks from different countries could not communicate with one another because they do not follow the same rule. Internet Protocol worked in November 1977 when the networks from the US, the UK and Norway all used the new protocol. Internet Protocol was adopted by ARPANET on January 1, 1983 and that became the internet that everybody is familiar with.
